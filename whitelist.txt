# Email Whitelist Configuration

# Whitelisted email addresses (exact match)
# Emails from these addresses will ALWAYS be processed, even if they match blacklist rules
# One email per line, comments start with #

# Important contacts
boss@company.com
client@important-client.com

# Whitelisted domains (all emails from these domains will be processed)
# Format: @domain.com
@my-company.com
@trusted-partner.com

# Examples (commented out):
# important-person@example.com
# @trusted-domain.com

# Note: Whitelist takes precedence over blacklist
# If an email matches both whitelist and blacklist, it will be processed
